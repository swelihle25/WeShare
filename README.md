#WeShare: A Social Expense Tracker
#Overview
Welcome to WeShare, a Social Expense Tracker web application! This project involves building both client and server components for a full-fledged web application that allows users to track shared expenses among friends.

#Learning Pathway
Iteration 1: Server-side Rendering
In this iteration, you will develop the HTTP server back-end with controllers that render web pages on the server, following the Server-side Rendering approach.

#Iteration 2: Client-side Rendering
The second iteration involves rewriting the client code for dynamic UI building in the browser using client-side rendering. New service endpoints and controller code will be implemented to handle JSON data.

#Iteration 3: Distributed Components
The final iteration focuses on implementing a real persistence system for data, introducing Object-Oriented Design Patterns for clean code and good Separation Of Concerns.
